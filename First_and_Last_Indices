''' 
Given a sorted array, A, with possibly duplicated elements, find the indices of the first and last occurrences of a target element, x. Return -1 if the target is not found.
'''

## plan: create first and last array index variables. set to to -1.   run thruogh list and update both indices. overwrite last index until end of list. if at least one of the variables is -1 then return -1 else return firts and last index

class Solution: 
  def getRange(self, arr, target):
    # create variable for first and last index
    first_index = -1
    last_index = -1
    first = 0
    for ii in range(len(arr)):
        if (arr[ii] == target) and first == 0:
            first_index = ii
            first +=1
        elif (arr[ii] == target) and first >=1:
            last_index = ii
            first +=1
    # print(first_index, last_index )
    if  first_index == -1  or last_index == -1:
        return -1
    return [first_index, last_index]

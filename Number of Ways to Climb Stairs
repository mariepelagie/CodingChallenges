## You are given a positive integer N which represents the number of steps in a staircase. 
## You can either climb 1 or 2 steps at a time. Write a function that returns the number of unique ways to climb the stairs.

# Method using Recursion
def staircase(n):
    # base case: for heights = 1 and height =2
    if n ==1:
        return 1
    elif n ==2:
        return 2
    ## Recursive case
    else:
        return  staircase(n-1)+ staircase(n-2)
      

  
print(staircase(4))
# 5
print(staircase(5))
# 8

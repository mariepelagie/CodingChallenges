## Prompt: There are n people lined up, and each have a height represented as an integer. 
## A murder has happened right in front of them, and only people who are taller than everyone 
## in front of them are able to see what has happened. How many witnesses are there?

## plan:
## start at end of the list and check if previous item is greater than current
## item. append counter and shift to the left

## Implementation
def witnesses(heights):
    ## define end index
    k = len(heights)-1
    ## set counter =1 to include last element that had no obstruction
    counter = 1
    ## traverse thru list right to left
    while k>0:
        ## cheak if current person is shorter person behind and update counter
        current = heights[k]
        if current < heights[k-1]:
            counter+=1
        k-=1
    return counter

## Test
print(witnesses([3, 6, 3, 4, 1]))
# 3
